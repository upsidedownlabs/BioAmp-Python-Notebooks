# BioAmp-Python-Notebooks

**BioAmp-Python-Notebooks** is an open-source collection of Python notebooks for biosignal processing, designed to make bio-potential signal analysis accessible to everyone. Whether you're working with BioAmp hardware or other acquisition systems, these notebooks provide complete workflows for processing and analyzing physiological signals.

## Featured Notebooks

- **ECG Signal Processing**: Complete pipeline for electrocardiogram analysis from acquisition to feature extraction
- **EMG Signal Processing**: End-to-end electromyography processing for muscle activity analysis

Perfect for:
- **Students** learning bio-potential signal processing
- **Researchers** needing reproducible analysis pipelines
- **Developers** building health-tech applications
- **Hobbyists** exploring physiological computing
